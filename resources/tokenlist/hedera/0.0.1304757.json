    "description": "Quant launched in June 2018 with the goal of connecting blockchains and networks on a global scale, without reducing the efficiency and interoperability of the network. It is the first project to solve the interoperability problem through the creation of the first blockchain operating system.\n\nThe project is built as an operating system distributed ledger technology\u2014 and Overledger Network \u2014 for connecting different blockchain networks. The project is billed as the first OS to be built for blockchains.\n\nThe main aim of Quant \u2014 using Overledger \u2014 is to bridge the gap that exists between different blockchains. Overledger allows developers to build decentralized multi-chain applications (known as MApps) for their customers. For developers to build a Mapp on the network, they must hold a certain amount of Quant tokens (QNT).\n\nNote: the [hts] subscript denotes that this asset has been bridged through hashport.",
