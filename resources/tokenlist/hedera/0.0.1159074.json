    "description": "GRELF is a Hedera meme coin. The total supply is 6.6 million (6,666,666) and there are no keys. \n\nGRELF is based around a weird, unappealing, and frankly ugly character named Gerbert the Grelf who was created as a spin-off from the CREETS NFT project. The juxtaposition that is created by having his character as the mascot for a meme coin is found to be funny by some.\n\nThis is not a utility project; this project is about fun and weirdness.",
