These pools are filled by users who deposit their funds into the pool and receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens in return.\n\nPancakeSwap allows users to trade BEP-20 tokens, provide liquidity to the exchange and earn fees, stake LP tokens to earn CAKE, stake CAKE to earn more CAKE and stake CAKE to earn tokens of other projects.\n\nNote: the [hts] subscript denotes that this asset has been bridged through hashport.",
