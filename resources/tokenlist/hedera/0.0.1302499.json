    "description": "GMX is a decentralized spot and perpetual exchange that supports low swap fees and zero price impact trades. Trading is supported by a unique multi-asset pool that earns liquidity providers fees from market making, swap fees, leverage trading (spreads, funding fees & liquidations) and asset rebalancing. Dynamic pricing is supported by Chainlink Oracles along with TWAP pricing from leading volume DEXs.\n\nGMX operates on a dual token model with GLP, the liquidity pool token, and GMX, the platform\u2019s governance token.\n\nGMX generates revenue through swap fees, borrow fees on leveraged trading, liquidations, and the minting and burning of GLP. These fees are split between GLP and GMX stakers.\n\nNote: the [hts] subscript denotes that this asset has been bridged through hashport.",
