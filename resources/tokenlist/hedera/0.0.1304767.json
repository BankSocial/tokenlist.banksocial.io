    "description": "Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that is partially owned and operated by its players. \n\nInspired by popular games like Pok\u00e9mon and Tamagotchi, Axie Infinity allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as Axies. These Axies can take various forms, and there are more than 500 different body parts available, including aquatic, beast, bird, bug, plant and reptile parts. Parts from each type class come in four different rarity scales: common, rare, ultra rare and legendary \u2014 and Axies can have any combination of body parts, making them highly variable and often rare and unique.\n\nAXS is the governance token for the Axie Infinity game. Token holders will be able to shape and vote for the direction of the game universe. This is unlike traditional games where all decisions are made by the game developers. AXS holders will be able to stake their tokens to earn more AXS and even vote for governance proposals.\n\nNote: the [hts] subscript denotes that this asset has been bridged through hashport.",
