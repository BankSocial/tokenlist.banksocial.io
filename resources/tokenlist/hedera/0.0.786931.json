    "description": "HbarSuite is a suite of DeFi services built on top of the Hedera network. The team has developed a technology that offers an alternative to smart contracts: the Smart-Nodes.\n\nSmart-Nodes are highly customizable programs, deployed inside virtual images which can be hosted and decentralized through cloud computing environments (ex. Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services). Their purpose is to create a decentralized network of services that could leverage the Hedera Layer-1 functionalities, which are much more efficient and cost-effective compared to Ethereum-based environments. \n\nHSUITE is the layer-1 utility token used as gas for the Smart-Nodes and as governance token for DAO activities.",
