    "description": "Platypus Finance protocol started as a single-side AMM (decentralized exchange) designed for exchanging stable cryptocurrencies (ERC-20 tokens) on the Avalanche blockchain. It combines both stableswap and stablecoin, utilizing Platypus\u2019 underlying assets.\n\nThe protocol is implemented as a set of smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody and maximum capital efficiency. The first-of-its-kind open liquidity pool stableswap sets the precedent for single-sided liquidity provision, redefining the concept of liquidity equilibrium through a novel approach which places liability at the center of our technology. The innovative pool design will eliminate impermanent loss risk for liquidity providers, and minimize slippage for traders.\n\nThis allows for integration of new assets, more use cases for the single-sided LP tokens, and organic growth of assets based on supply and demand. Platypus further utilizes its capital to mint stablecoins: the USP. All these innovations are neatly wrapped in a sleek user interface for easy on-ramp.\n\nPTP is the native token of Platypus Finance.\n\nNote: the [hts] subscript denotes that this asset has been bridged through hashport.",
