    "description": "DAI is an Ethereum-based stablecoin (stable-price cryptocurrency) whose issuance and development is managed by the Maker Protocol and the MakerDAO decentralized autonomous organization.\n\nThe price of DAI is soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar and is collateralized by a mix of other cryptocurrencies that are deposited into smart contract vaults every time new DAI is minted.\n\nIt is important to differentiate between Multi-Collateral DAI and Single-Collateral DAI (SAI), an earlier version of the token that could only be collateralized by a single cryptocurrency; SAI also doesn\u2019t support the DAI Savings Rate, which allows users to earn savings by holding DAI tokens.\n\nNote: the [hts] subscript denotes that this asset has been bridged through hashport.",
