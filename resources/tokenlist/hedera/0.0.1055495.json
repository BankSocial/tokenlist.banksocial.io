    "description": "Founded in 2017, Chainlink is a blockchain abstraction layer that enables universally connected smart contracts. Through a decentralized oracle network, Chainlink allows blockchains to securely interact with external data feeds, events, and payment methods; providing the critical off-chain information needed by complex smart contracts to become the dominant form of digital agreement.\n\nThe Chainlink Network is driven by a large open-source community of data providers, node operators, smart contract developers, researchers, security auditors, and more. The company focuses on ensuring that decentralized participation is guaranteed for all node operators and users looking to contribute to the network.\n\nNote: the [hts] subscript denotes that this asset has been bridged through hashport.",
