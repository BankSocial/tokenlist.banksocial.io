    "description": "WETH is the tokenized/packaged form of ETH that allows users to pay for items when they interact with Ethereum dApps. WETH follows the ERC-20 token standard, enabling it to achieve interoperability with other ERC-20 tokens.\n\nThis offers more utility to holders as they can use it across networks and dApps. They can stake, yield farm, lend, and provide liquidity to various liquidity pools with WETH.\n\nAlso, unlike ETH, which doesn\u2019t conform to its own ERC-20 standard and thus has lower interoperability as it can\u2019t be used on other chains besides Ethereum, WETH can be used on cheaper and high-throughput alternatives like Hedera, Binance, and Polygon.\n\nNote: the [hts] subscript denotes that this asset has been bridged through hashport.",
