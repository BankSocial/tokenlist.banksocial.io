    "description": "Hedera is a public, open source, proof-of-stake network, with native cryptocurrency HBAR.  HBAR is used to pay application transaction fees and protect the network from attack through proof-of-stake. When HBAR is staked to network nodes, it has a weighted influence on consensus for validating transactions.  Developers use HBAR to pay for network services, such as transferring tokens, minting fungible and non-fungible tokens, calling smart contracts, and logging data. For every transaction submitted to the network, HBAR is used to pay fees that compensate validator nodes for bandwidth, compute, and storage.",
